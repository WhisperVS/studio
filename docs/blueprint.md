# **App Name**: AssetZen

## Core Features:

- Theme Selection: Allow users to choose from multiple themes (Dark, Light, etc.) to customize the application's appearance.
- Asset Creation: Enable users to manually add new assets to the inventory with detailed information.
- CSV Export: Export the entire asset inventory to a CSV file for external reporting and analysis.
- Dropdown Population: Use a tool to analyze the notes to suggest standard values and populate all dropdown menus when adding new assets, ensuring data consistency. Example include categories (systems, servers, laptops, networks, printers, other) or manufacture. Leverage local storage.
- Asset Details: Capture comprehensive details for each asset, including Machine Name, Category, System OS, Location (Schaumburg IL or Rockford IL), Manufacture, Part/Model/Serial Numbers, Type (system/server), Assigned User (local/remote), Owner (read-only Group Administrators), Status, Notes, Purchase/Warranty Dates.
- Type-Specific Fields: Implement conditional display of fields based on asset type. For 'systems', show options like MFF, Tower, AiO, Desktop. For 'servers', display options such as Rack, Tower, Blade.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#9400D3). This color is strongly associated with both 'admin' tasks as well as contemporary designs.
- Background color: Very light violet (#F0E5F5) provides a contrasting, calming backdrop that won't fatigue eyes.
- Accent color: Purple-tinged blue (#6A5ACD), for interactive elements to guide user actions without clashing.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a readable sans-serif to provide an easy reading experience
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a techy sans-serif font is well-matched to the theme, especially for headers
- Use minimalist, clear icons for asset categories and actions, with a style that complements the selected font.
- Maintain a clean, well-organized layout with clear hierarchy and consistent spacing to ensure ease of use and readability.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide visual feedback and enhance the user experience when interacting with the inventory.
